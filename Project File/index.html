        Renewable energy, such as wind and solar energy, plays an increasing role
        in the supply of energy worldwide. This trend will continue because global
        energy demand is increasing.
        </p>

        <p>
        However, levels of production of wind energy are hard to predict as they
        rely on unstable weather conditions present at the wind farm.
